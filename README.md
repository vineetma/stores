# README.md

In Indian, ageless education system, it is observed that learning is not complete till there is a change in person. To make that change one has go go through three stages:
+ Upasana (being close to the guru, keeping ears, eyes open and mind focussed)
+ Sadhna (practising whatever is being taught)
+ Aradhana (start applying whatever is learnt for the general good)

In line with this belief, which I find interesting. In today's fast moving world, where listener also wants to hear keywords, learner also wants to learn keywords, God knows who is working enough to produce things. Work left at upasana is wasted effort of both guru and disciple. Toda Guru has been replaced with internet in several contexts. Or I may say, inner self is the Guru where content is read externally but an effort to decipher and understand has to be done by disciple himself.

#Assumptions
I assume that user has basic knowledge of Programming, Java. Most importantly, he has lot of inquisitiveness. This tutorial is a tool to get exposure to basics, critical to create worthwhile system. It is not meant to score 100% marks in some certification. It is part of Sadhna.

#Problem Statement
Problem that we will solve in this tutorial is to create a store ledger system using spring framework. So what it means?

+ Create a store
+ Create items, map them to category and store them in store
+ Issue them, Receive them
+ Maintain balance of each item
+ Add project where these items are consumed
+ Create reports
    * Which project has consumed how many items
    * All items each with opening balance, purchased, consumed, balance
    * Value in terms of Rs for opening balance, purchased, consumed, balance
+ Improve the code to implement First in first out cost

In next project, extension of this, we will do more. Look out for updates to this page - we will add databases, authentication, estimation, threshold, indentation and more..

#Resources
Project source is available here, which should be very simple with lot of opportunities to improve. Feel free to adapt and use it at your end.

Step by step documentation to learn on building up this code while learning various advance concepts. Please visit [Github Pages](http://vineetma.github.io/springtutorial)

Thanks.
